"Matplotlib images that are generated will be saved to disk, and the rST "
"generated will display these images with the built examples. By default "
"only images generated by Matplotlib, or packages based on Matplotlib "
"(e.g., Seaborn or Yellowbrick) are saved and displayed. However, you can "
"change this to include other packages, see :ref:`image_scrapers`."

"Additionally, you may embed rST syntax within your Python scripts. rST "
"allows you to easily add formatted text, math equations and reference "
"links, including :ref:`cross referencing other examples "
"<cross_ref_example>`. This will be rendered in-line with the Python code "
"and its outputs, similar to how Jupyter Notebooks are structured (in "
"fact, Sphinx-Gallery also **creates** a Jupyter Notebook for each example"
" that is built)."

"You can embed rST in your Python examples by including a line of >= 20 "
"``#`` symbols, ``#%%``, or ``# %%``. For consistency, it is recommended "
"that you use only one of the above three 'block splitter' options in your"
" project. If using a line of ``#``'s, we recommend using 79 ``#``'s, like"
" this::"

"Any commented lines (line beginning with ``#`` followed by a space, to be"
" PEP8-compliant) that immediately follow a block splitter will be "
"rendered as rST in the built gallery examples. To switch back to writing "
"code, either stop starting lines with ``#`` and a space or leave an empty"
" line before writing code comments. You can thus easily alternate between"
" text and code 'blocks'. For example::"

"editors/IDEs may only mention one of ``#%%`` or ``# %%``, in practice "
"both work. With these editors/IDEs, ``#%%`` or ``# %%`` at the start of a"

"separate your code into chunks, like in Jupyter Notebooks. All the code "
"within a code block can be easily executed together. This functionality "
