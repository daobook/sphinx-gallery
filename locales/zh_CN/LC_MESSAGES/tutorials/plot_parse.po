"Sphinx-Gallery is capable of transforming Python files into rST files "
"with a notebook structure. For this to be used you need to respect some "
"syntax rules. This example demonstrates how to alternate text and code "
"blocks and some edge cases. It was designed to be compared with the "
":download:`source Python script <plot_parse.py>`."
